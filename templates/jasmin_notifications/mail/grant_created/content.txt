Hi {{ user.first_name }},
{% if target.user.service_user %}
The following access has been granted:

    Service: {{ target.role.service }}
    Role: {{ target.role.name }}
    User: {{ target.user }}
    Expires: {{ target.expires }}

You are receiving this email as a designated responsible user for this service user.
{% elif target.role.service.name == "jasmin-login" and target.role.name == "USER" %}
You have been granted jasmin-login access, which means you can make full use of the
interactive and batch computing facilities on JASMIN.

The JASMIN documentation, https://help.jasmin.ac.uk, has many articles describing how to use the
different JASMIN services and how to overcome common issues. Scenario-based training exercises
from our regular JASMIN Workshops are useful for learning best practice on JASMIN and are
available at https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-workshop.

It is important that you familiarise yourself with the constraints of JASMIN’s hardware and
infrastructure. Misuse, even if accidental, can impact system performance for everyone.
Please make sure you understand these constraints by reading the documentation.

If you can’t find an answer in the documentation, you can contact us at support@ceda.ac.uk.
